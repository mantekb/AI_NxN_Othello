This project is for assignment 4.

Designed the othello(reversi) game for arbitrary size board (nxn).

This repository contains a .cpp file containing the code for the project
and a zip file containing the whole project.

The code has been compiled in Visual Studio 2017 enterprise edition.

Open project in Visual Studio by clicking on the .sln file in the project folder.
Then compile and run (start without debugging option in visual studio).

The 'X' represent black and 'O' represent white. Black makes the first move.
This code outputs the winner and by what score the winner won the game.

Note: For 8x8 it takes around 180 seconds(in my laptop's configuration) to run but gives the output.
